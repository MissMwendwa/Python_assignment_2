The main difference between both the statements is that when break keyword comes,
 it terminates the execution of the current loop and passes the control over the next loop or main body, whereas when continue keyword is encountered, 
it skips the current iteration and executes the very next iteration in the loop

#Demonstration of Python break statement 
#using for loop 
#loop from 0 to 9 
for i in range(10): 
       # if i is equal to 6 
       # break statement terminate the current working loop   
       if i == 6: 
             break 
       else: 
              print (i)

#Demonstration of Python continue statement 
#using for loop 
#loop from 0 to 9 
for i in range(10): 
       # if i is equal to 2 
       # continue statement will skip   
       #and start executing next iteration 
       if i == 2: 
             continue 
        else: 
              print (i)
